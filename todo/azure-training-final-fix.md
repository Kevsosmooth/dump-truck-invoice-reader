# Azure Training - Final Fix Applied

## The Issue
Azure Document Intelligence couldn't find training data even though files existed in blob storage.

## Root Cause
Azure expects different URL formats for labeled (template) vs unlabeled (neural) training:
- **Labeled training**: URL must point directly to the folder containing the data
- **Unlabeled training**: Can use container URL + prefix parameter

## Fix Applied
Modified `startModelTraining` in azure-training-service.ts to:

1. **For Template (labeled) training**:
   - Append the folder path to the container URL: `${containerUrl}/${folderPath}`
   - Don't use the prefix parameter
   - Example: `https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/training-documents/demo-user/project-id`

2. **For Neural (unlabeled) training**:
   - Use container URL with prefix parameter
   - Example: URL = container, prefix = `demo-user/project-id`

## What Happens Now

### With the fix:
```
Container URL: https://...blob.core.windows.net/training-documents?sv=...
Folder: demo-user/f8b297d1-92a4-4a22-a1fb-7c694110c56d

For labeled training:
- Training URL: https://...blob.core.windows.net/training-documents/demo-user/f8b297d1-92a4-4a22-a1fb-7c694110c56d?sv=...
- Prefix: undefined
```

### Enhanced Logging Shows:
- Exact URL being sent to Azure
- Files found before training
- Training mode (template/neural)
- Any validation errors

## Expected Result
Training should now start successfully because Azure will look for files at:
`/demo-user/f8b297d1-92a4-4a22-a1fb-7c694110c56d/`

Where it will find:
- `{uuid}_document.pdf`
- `{uuid}_document.pdf.labels.json`
- `{uuid}_document.pdf.ocr.json`

## To Test
1. Restart the server to apply changes
2. Try training again
3. Check the new detailed logs
4. Training should start without "TrainingContentMissing" error

## If Still Failing
The enhanced logging will show:
- The exact training URL being used
- Whether it's using folder URL or container+prefix
- File validation results
- More specific error messages
