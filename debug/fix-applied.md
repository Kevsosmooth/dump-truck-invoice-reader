# Fix Applied Successfully

## What Was Wrong
We were trying to be "smart" by appending the folder path to the URL for labeled training:
```
https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/training-documents/demo-user/project-id?sv=...
```

This caused the error: "Source Uri must include container path" because Azure interpreted the modified URL incorrectly.

## The Fix
Reverted to using the standard approach for BOTH labeled and unlabeled training:
- **URL**: Points to the container only
- **Prefix**: Specifies the folder path

```javascript
// Now both training modes use:
trainingDataUrl: "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/training-documents?sv=..."
prefix: "demo-user/project-id"
```

## Key Learning
The error message "Source Uri must include container path" was misleading. It doesn't mean "add the folder path to the URL". It means "the URL must point to a container, not deeper".

## Result
Training should now work! The Azure API will:
1. Access the container using the SAS URL
2. Look for files in the subfolder specified by the prefix
3. Find all the PDFs, labels, and OCR files
4. Start training successfully

## To Test
1. Restart the server
2. Try training again
3. Should see "Training progress: running" instead of errors
