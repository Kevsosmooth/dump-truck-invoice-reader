# Correction Needed

## What I Got Wrong
1. I thought the "sample value" in labels was the problem
2. I added a text input dialog for users to manually enter text
3. This is NOT how template models work!

## How Template Models Actually Work
1. You draw boxes to show WHERE fields are
2. You specify WHAT TYPE of field (date, number, etc.)
3. Azure learns to extract text from those locations
4. You DON'T manually enter the text values

## The Real Problem
Empty OCR files with no text content:
- OCR files must contain the actual text from the document
- Azure uses these to understand what text exists at labeled locations
- Without OCR data, Azure reports "TrainingContentMissing"

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Keep the UI Change
- Use the text input to help generate OCR files
- When user enters text, we know what's at that location
- Build OCR files from user input

### Option 2: Revert the UI Change  
- Remove the text input dialog
- Implement proper OCR generation using Azure Layout API
- This is the "correct" way but requires more work

### Option 3: Switch to Neural Model
- Neural models don't require labeling
- Just need 5+ similar documents
- Might be easier for this use case

## Recommendation
For immediate testing:
1. Keep the text input dialog
2. Use entered text to generate proper OCR files
3. This will at least let us test if training works
4. Later implement proper OCR with Layout API
