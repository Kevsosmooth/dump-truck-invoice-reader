# Solution Found: Azure Training Error

## The Problem
Error: "Invalid content source: Source Uri must include container path"

## Root Cause
We've been trying to use a folder-specific URL for training, but Azure expects:
1. The URL should point to the CONTAINER (not a folder within it)
2. Use the `prefix` parameter to specify the folder path

## Current (Wrong) Approach
```javascript
// We're doing this:
trainingUrl: "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/training-documents/demo-user/project-id?sv=..."
prefix: undefined
```

## Correct Approach
```javascript
// Should be:
trainingUrl: "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/training-documents?sv=..." // Container URL only
prefix: "demo-user/project-id" // Folder path as prefix
```

## Key Insight from Microsoft Docs
- "The Folder path should be empty if your training documents are in the root of the container"
- "If your documents are in a subfolder, enter the relative path from the container root"
- The Source URI must include the container path (meaning it should point to the container, not deeper)

## What Needs to Change
In `azure-training-service.ts`, we need to REVERT the labeled training approach:
- Don't append the folder to the URL
- Keep using the container URL + prefix parameter
- This is the same for both labeled and unlabeled training

The error "Source Uri must include container path" actually means the URL must include the container NAME in the path (training-documents), not that it needs the full folder path!
