# CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND - Root Cause of TrainingContentMissing

## Discovery Time
2025-07-06 18:30 UTC

## The Problem
Azure Document Intelligence training has been failing with "TrainingContentMissing" error.

## Root Cause Found
The label files in Azure Blob Storage all contain `"text": "sample value"` instead of the actual text content from the documents.

### Evidence
Checked label files in blob storage:
```json
{
  "document": "3b6dd6c6-96fa-4137-aafc-5b804112884f_SILVI SAND OF EAGLESLAKE_Date_June-27-2025_Ticket#89832.pdf",
  "labels": [{
    "label": "date",
    "key": null,
    "value": [{
      "page": 1,
      "text": "sample value",  // <-- THIS IS THE PROBLEM
      "boundingBoxes": [[120.19, 191.72, 160.19, 191.72, 160.19, 207.51, 120.19, 207.51]]
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Code Location
In `/client/src/components/ModelTraining/DocumentLabeling.tsx`:
- Line 234: `value: '', // Would extract from OCR in real app`
- Line 275: `value: label.value || 'sample value',`

Since `label.value` is always empty, it defaults to 'sample value' for ALL labels.

## Why This Causes TrainingContentMissing
Azure Document Intelligence uses the text values in labels to:
1. Validate that the labeled regions actually contain text
2. Train the model to recognize patterns in the text
3. Associate field types with text patterns

When all labels have "sample value", Azure can't find any real training content.

## Solution Required
The frontend needs to:
1. Extract actual text from the document at the labeled coordinates
2. Use OCR or document analysis to get the text within bounding boxes
3. Send the real text values instead of "sample value"

## Impact
This explains why:
- Files are uploaded successfully
- Label and OCR files are created
- But Azure still reports "TrainingContentMissing"

The training data is structurally correct but semantically invalid.
