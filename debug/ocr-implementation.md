# OCR Implementation Complete

## Changes Made (2025-07-06 19:30 UTC)

### 1. Added OCR Generation Using Layout API
Created `generateOcrData` method that:
- Uses Azure's prebuilt-layout model
- Extracts all text with coordinates
- Formats data in v2.1 OCR format expected by training

### 2. Updated Document Upload Process
- Created `uploadTrainingDocumentWithOcr` method
- Automatically generates OCR when PDFs are uploaded
- OCR files are created immediately after document upload

### 3. Fixed OCR Format
OCR files now contain:
```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "analyzeResult": {
    "readResults": [{
      "lines": [
        {
          "boundingBox": [x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4],
          "text": "Actual text from document",
          "words": [...]
        }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 4. Removed OCR Generation from Label Save
- OCR files are now created during document upload
- No longer need to generate empty OCR files during labeling

## How It Works Now

1. **Document Upload**:
   - PDF is uploaded to blob storage
   - Layout API analyzes the document
   - OCR file with actual text is generated and saved

2. **Labeling**:
   - User draws boxes around fields
   - Specifies field type (date, number, etc.)
   - Text values from user input can help validate but aren't required

3. **Training**:
   - Azure finds OCR files with actual text content
   - Matches labeled regions with text in those regions
   - Trains model successfully

## Important Notes

### About the Text Input Dialog
- For template models, users don't need to enter text values
- The dialog can be kept for validation or removed
- Azure extracts text from OCR files, not from labels

### API Usage
- Each document upload now triggers a Layout API call
- This may increase costs but is required for training
- Consider caching OCR results if re-uploading same documents

### Next Steps
1. Test with new document uploads
2. Verify OCR files contain actual text
3. Attempt training with properly generated files
4. Consider removing or repurposing the text input dialog
