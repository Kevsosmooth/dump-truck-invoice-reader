# The REAL Root Cause - Empty OCR Files

## Correction to Previous Analysis
I was wrong about the text values in labels. For template models:
- You DON'T need to manually enter text values
- You just show WHERE fields are and WHAT TYPE they are
- Azure extracts the text during training

## The Actual Problem
The OCR files (.ocr.json) are empty! They contain:
```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "recognitionResults": [{
    "page": 1,
    "width": 8.5,
    "height": 11,
    "unit": "inch",
    "lines": []  // <-- THIS IS EMPTY! Should have text lines
  }]
}
```

## What OCR Files Should Contain
OCR files must have the actual text extracted from the document with coordinates:
```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "recognitionResults": [{
    "page": 1,
    "width": 8.5,
    "height": 11,
    "unit": "inch",
    "lines": [
      {
        "boundingBox": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4],
        "text": "Invoice #89832",
        "words": [
          {
            "boundingBox": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4],
            "text": "Invoice"
          },
          {
            "boundingBox": [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4],
            "text": "#89832"
          }
        ]
      },
      // ... more lines
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Why This Causes TrainingContentMissing
Azure Document Intelligence:
1. Reads the OCR files to understand what text is in the document
2. Matches labeled regions with text in those regions
3. Trains the model to extract similar text from similar locations

With empty OCR files, Azure literally finds no training content!

## The Solution
We need to:
1. Use Azure Document Intelligence Layout API to analyze each PDF
2. Generate proper OCR files with actual text and coordinates
3. THEN do the labeling
4. THEN train the model

## Note About My Previous Fix
The text input dialog I added is NOT needed for template models. We should:
- Either remove it 
- OR use it differently (to help generate better OCR files)
- OR switch to a neural model approach
