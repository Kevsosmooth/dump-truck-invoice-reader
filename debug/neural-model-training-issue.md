# Neural Model Training Issue

## Current Status
Neural model training is failing with the same "TrainingContentMissing" error.

## Observations
1. Files are present in blob storage (5 PDFs, 5 labels, 5 OCR files)
2. Using container URL with prefix parameter (as per our current code)
3. Training is being triggered twice (duplicate requests?)

## Potential Issues

### 1. Neural Models May Need Different Approach
According to some Azure docs, neural models might need:
- Direct folder URL (like template models)
- Different file organization
- Different SAS permissions

### 2. File Format Issues
Neural models might be more strict about:
- OCR file format
- Label file format
- File naming conventions

### 3. API Version Compatibility
The SDK is using api-version=2023-07-31
- This should support both neural and template models
- But there might be specific requirements

## Next Steps
1. Try using folder-specific URL for neural models too
2. Check if OCR files have proper content
3. Verify label files are correctly formatted
