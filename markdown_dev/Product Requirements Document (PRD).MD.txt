Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Automated Invoice Processing System
1. Executive Summary
A web-based document processing system that allows users to upload PDF documents, automatically splits multi-page PDFs into individual pages, processes each page through Azure Document Intelligence to extract invoice data, renames files based on extracted information, and provides a downloadable ZIP archive with all processed documents and an Excel summary report.
2. Problem Statement
Users need to process large volumes of invoices that are often combined in multi-page PDF documents. Manual separation, data extraction, and file renaming is time-consuming and error-prone. The system should handle interruptions gracefully and ensure users can retrieve their processed documents within 24 hours.
3. Goals & Objectives

Automate the splitting of multi-page PDFs into individual invoice pages
Extract structured data from each invoice using Azure Document Intelligence
Rename files based on extracted data (CompanyName_TicketNumber_Date.pdf)
Provide batch processing capabilities for hundreds of documents
Ensure system resilience against browser refreshes and interruptions
Maintain user privacy by auto-deleting data after 24 hours

4. User Stories
4.1 As a user, I want to:

Upload multiple PDF files at once (drag & drop or file selector)
See upload progress for each file
Have multi-page PDFs automatically split into individual pages
Review uploaded pages before processing
